    title:
        "Accelerating Innovation for Rainforest Biodiversity Assessment in a Complex Ecosystem using AI",
    description:
        "Developed novel technologies for Floral and Fauna Species Identification to be categorized into some level of Taxonomic groups. We utilized AWS SageMaker Studio for data mining and data labeling to build highly accurate species training and test datasets. Orchestrated ETL processes using in-house Python clients on open-access data warehouses for further analysis. Finally deployed interactive dashboards for the client to visualize the surveyed information for a comprehensive study.",

    title: "Forum Posts Clustering and Document Embedding",
    description:
        "Incorporated Hierarchical document clustering to cluster forum posts from Meta Kaggle. I utilized a lightweight and unsupervised keyword extraction algorithm, YAKE, to extract important keywords from each document followed by feature engineering. Fine-tuned Word2Vec document vectors using GoogleNews embeddings which greatly increased the validation accuracy by 15.7%. ",

    title: "Automated Driver Drowsiness Control Android Application",
    description:
        "Developed the methodology to detect and predict driver drowsiness at early stages using physical and physiological variables. A feasibility test is conducted to evaluate the accuracy and performance of the proposed methodology. AI techniques like Google Vision are utilized to analyze data for monitoring, detecting, predicting, and controlling driver drowsiness. An Android application developed in Java is prepared end-to-end for the user and applied for data collection in future research experiments.",
